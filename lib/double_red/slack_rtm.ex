    Hi there! Since this is our first conversation, let me tell you a bit about how I work.

    Watch my status to quickly see if there's a free bathroom. Green means go! Other than that, anytime you message me I'll let you know which downstairs bathroom, if any, is free.

    I understand you work for a security company, so you're probably looking for some technical details. I work using a color sensor (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1334) attached to a WiFi microcontroller (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2471). Every second or so I send the color I read from the lock label to a server (https://double-red.herokuapp.com/api/wafts). The color information I pick up is transient -â€” I only hold on to as many records as I need to function. This information is conveniently distilled for you using Slack.

    Cheers,
    @double_red
